The ''python-project-49'' project consists of 5 games:
1. "Even Check" - during the game a number will be presented, the user will be prompted to determine if the number presented is even or odd?
2. "Calculator" - an arithmetic problem will be presented, the user will be asked to solve it.
3. "GCD" - in this game the user will be asked to determine the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
4. "Arithmetic progression" - during the game the user will be asked to find out the missing number in the arithmetic progression.
5. "Is it a prime number?" - the user will be presented with a number, his task is to determine whether it is prime.
After launching one of the games, the user will have 1 attempt and 3 questions.
